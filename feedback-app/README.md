I begin making this app by providing context about my app, including the tech stack and the specific features I want to implement. By specifying file paths and structures, I receive tailored code suggestions from GPT that I modify to fit my needs. I also use tools like Git for version control and utilities like Prettier and ESLint to maintain code quality. In terms of design, I focus on basic UI/UX principles, creating an app that is easy and intuitive to use, with a pleasant interface that engages users. By prioritizing user experience in my design decisions, I aim to build applications that are both functional and enjoyable. Overall, I used GPT to help me create app from start to finish with me modifying or changing code where needed, as well as changing files structure.
